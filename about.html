        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
            Hi! I'm Robert Terquin C. Laqui, a 20-year-old IT student at St. Dominic College of Asia. I have a strong passion for technology and love building things with code. 
            I enjoy solving problems, learning new skills, and working on creative projects. 
            In my free time, I like playing basketball, cycling, and exploring new ideas in programming. 
            Every weekend, I go for a bike ride to relax and stay active. 
            My dream is to become a mobile app developer so I can create apps that help people and make life easier. 
            I'm always excited to learn and improve, and I'm working hard to achieve my goals in the tech world!
